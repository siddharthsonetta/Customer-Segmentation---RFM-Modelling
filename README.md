# Customer-Segmentation - RFM Modelling

What is Customer Segmentation?

Customer segmentation is a method of dividing customers into groups or clusters on the basis of common characteristics.
The market researcher can segment customers into the B2C model using various customer’s demographic characteristics such as occupation, gender, age, location, and marital status. Psychographic characteristics such as social class, lifestyle and personality characteristics, and behavioral characteristics such as spending, consumption habits, product/service usage, and previously purchased products.
In the B2B model using various company’s characteristics such as the size of the company, type of industry, and location.

Customer Segmentation using RFM analysis

RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary) analysis is a behavior-based approach grouping customers in segments. 
It groups the customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions. How recently how often and how much did the customer buy. 

Recency (R): Who has purchased recently? Number of days since last purchase (least recency)

Frequency (F): Who has purchased frequently? It means the total number of purchases. (High frequency) [Transaction/ TAT (total number of transactions or average time between transactions/ engaged visits)]

Monetary Value (M): Who has a high purchase amount? It means the total money customer spent (high monetary value)

Each of the three variables (Recency, Frequency and Monetary) consists of four equal groups, which creates 64 (4x4x4) different customer segments. Steps of RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary): Calculate the Recency, Frequency, Monetary values for each customer. Add segment bin values to the RFM table using quartile. Sort the customer RFM score in ascending order.
